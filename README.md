H9 Analytics GC

1. **y.csv** contains the prediction csv for test data of 1000 samples. It is just a single column csv file with no other column, nor index column, just the column containing predicted values i.e, 1 or 0, signifying y for test samples.
2. ann_h9gc.h5 is ANN model trained on given 10000 samples. 
3. The other two are notebook files, or code files I worked on.
